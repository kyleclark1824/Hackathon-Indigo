# Hackathon Team Indigo Project

This project demonstrates using the JSSDK to enroll a user and do simple string encryption/decryption. 
Our project aims to make life easier for first time users
to get acquainted with Ionic. 


# Before running the application

   Deveng AR DEV teant. Reach out to Kyle Clark if you need a user created.
